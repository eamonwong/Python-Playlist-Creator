# Technologies Used 🛠️
| Component	| Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Python | Core backend logic and API interactions |
| Flask	 | Web framework for the dashboard interface |
| Spotipy |	Python library for Spotify Web API integration |

| OAuth2 |	Secure authentication flow |
| JavaScript	| Dynamic frontend interactions (search, add songs) |

# Why This Project? 🎯
## The Problem:
Manually creating playlists on Spotify can be tedious. As a music lover and programmer, I wanted to:
- Automate playlist curation while keeping creative control
- Improve the search experience (expanded from 4 to 10 results)
- Add session management so users can create multiple playlists without re-logging in

## Key Improvements:
- ✅ Finish Button: Clears playlist data without logging out (unlike traditional logout)
- ✅ Enhanced Search: More results (10 vs original 4) for better song discovery
- ✅ Error Handling: Friendly alerts for expired tokens or missing playlist

# Security Notes 🔐
**Critical: Protect Your Credentials**

```bash
.env Example (NEVER commit this file!) 
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here 
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here 
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=a_random_string_here 
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=your_spotipy_redirect_uri_here
```

1. Add .env to .gitignore

```bash
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

2. Spotify Dashboard Setup
- Register your app at Spotify Developer Dashboard
- Whitelist your redirect URI 

3. Token Safety
- Access tokens auto-expire in 1 hour
- Refresh tokens are stored securely in server sessions

# Tips & Tricks 💡
- Playlist Limits: Spotify allows up to 10,000 songs per playlist
- Rate Limits: The API allows ~30 requests per minute
- Debugging: Check Flask console for token errors

# Future Ideas 🌟
- Add collaborative playlist support
- Implement genre/mood-based recommendations
- Export playlists to JSON for backup
